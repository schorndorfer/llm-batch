          "text": "Below is a summary of a study from an academic paper:\n \nThe study aimed to test how two different drugs impact whether a patient recovers from a certain disease. Subjects were randomly drawn from a fixed population and then randomly assigned to Drug A or Drug B. Fifty-two percent (52%) of subjects who took Drug A recovered from the disease while forty-four percent (44%) of subjects who took Drug B recovered from the disease.\n \nA test of the null hypothesis that there is no difference between Drug A and Drug B in terms of probability of recovery from the disease yields a *p*-value of 0.0.49.\n \nAssuming no prior studies have been conducted with these drugs, which of the following statements is most accurate\n\nOption A. A person drawn randomly from the same population as the subjects in the study is **more likely** to recover from the disease if given Drug A than if given Drug B.\n\nOption B. A person drawn randomly from the same population as the subjects in the study is **less likely** to recover from the disease if given Drug A than if given Drug B.\n\nOption C. A person drawn randomly from the same population as the subjects in the study is  **equally likely** to recover from the disease if given Drug A than if given Drug B.\n\nOption D. It **cannot be determined** whether a person drawn randomly from the same population as the subjects in the study is more / less / equally likely to recover from the disease if given Drug A or if given Drug B.\n\nPlease answer only Option A, Option B, Option C, or Option D.",
